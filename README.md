AlphaBlog Indie Game Devblog Theme for Tumblr
==============

# Welcome!

AlphaBlog is a fully responsive Tumblr theme designed with the needs of indie game developers in mind. One of the best ways to start getting attention for your game is to share the development process with your fans and with other developers. AlphaBlog gives you a quick way to set up a beautiful Tumblr devblog for your indie game.

If you bought the theme, thank you! Your support will enable us to continue learning and developing solutions for the many problems indie game developers face finding their game's audience.

If you're just here browsing, thanks for stopping by. We hope you like the blog and decide to grab a copy to start blogging about a game in development or a game you'll be starting on soon.

We welcome your feedback, complaints, high-fives, and critiques. Feel free to email me at [devon@powerupgames.io](mailto:devon@powerupgames.io). If you use the theme, please email us a link. We do this because we love games, and it would be extremely gratifying to see *your* game displayed on the theme we built. You just might make a few new fans in the process.

# Installing the Theme

We've made installing the theme as simple as we possibly can.

1. Log in to Tumblr.
1. Customize the blog where you'd like to install the theme.<br>

1. Unzip the theme package.
1. Open the index.html file.
2. Copy the entire contents of the index.html file.
3. Paste that into Tumblr's Edit HTML field overwriting the current contents.
4. Click Update Preview.

You should also disable the Tumblr alternate mobile theme so that the AlphaBlog theme can do all the heavy lifting for phones, tablets, and other devices.

2. Turn off the Use default mobile theme option.
3. Click Save.

# Theme Options

Now that installation is complete, it's time to customize your theme. You can leave the theme defaults in place, and you'll still have a nice looking blog. Video games are generally a very visual medium, though, so a little customization can make the blog reflect the look and style of your game.

Through the options, we also expose important functionality like analytics and comments. Give them a glance so you know which options are available to you.

## Title

The title is displayed in a box overlayed on the header image.

## Description

The description is shown in the navigation drawer just under the search.

## Avatar

If you upload an avatar and turn on the "Show avatar" option, the avatar will appear above the title in the header image overlay.

## Header image

The header image is displayed prominently on the blog. On small devices, it will appear the full height of the viewport at the top of the page. On other devices, it will always be to the left of the main content, displayed the full height of the browser.

This is a great opportunity to show off a screenshot or some concept art. When you're selecting a header image, keep in mind that roughly the bottom third of the image will be obscured by the blog info (name, avatar, and tagline).

The header image is always oriented vertically, so find a nice, tall image for use here.

## Colors

We've used the three default color settings extensively throughout the theme. Changing these will have dramatic effects on your theme.

### Background color

This is used for the background of the page and a few other smaller elements. Make sure it has good contrast with both the title color and the accent color.

### Title color

This is used for most text in the theme including headings and body copy. It's also used to color the icons at the bottom of each post. Make sure it has good contrast with the background color.

### Accent color

The accent color is used in several different contexts:

* text links
* box surrounding the question in answer posts
* box surrounding the link in link posts.
* current page in the paginator
* hover color for the icons at the bottom of the post

It should have good contrast with the background color.

## Background Image

We all know what the background image does. What you may not have considered is that you should still set a background color that contrasts with your accent and title colors even if you use a background image. Although the page background will be covered by the image, the background color is used in a few other instances as well.

## Fonts

Choose from a variety of [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts/) for your theme. You can select different fonts for body text, headings, and highlighted code.

* [Source Sans Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
* [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans)
* [Roboto](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto)
* [PT Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Sans)
* [Dosis](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Dosis)
* [Titillium Web](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Titillium+Web)
* [PT Serif](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/PT+Serif)
* [Playfair](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Playfair+Display)
* [Old Standard TT](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Old+Standard+TT)
* [Merriweather](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather)
* [Roboto Slab](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Slab)
* [Arvo](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Arvo)
* [Inconsolata](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Inconsolata)
* [Anonymous Pro](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Anonymous+Pro)

You may also choose the weights for each of the fonts. If you're not sure what to do here, you're best off sticking with the default weights of 200 for body copy and 400 for bold. If you do decide to change the font weight, you should check the font's page at Google Fonts to be sure it is offered in the desired weight. 

If you select a weight that is not available (for instance 100 weight Source Sans Pro), Google Fonts will instead deliver the regular weight (400 in this case).

## Tagline

The tagline is displayed under the title in the header overlay.

## URLs

You'd like your super-fans who are reading your dev blog to take the next step in supporting your game. If your game is out, that's probably buying your game. If your game is coming, it may be crowdfunding support or a vote on Steam Greenlight. Whatever the case, AlphaBlog has you covered.

Enter the URL for your game's page on the appropriate service, and we'll add a slick banner to the navigation drawer that will take people to the URL you entered. It's a great way to tell your fans how they can help.

## Facebook Admins

Enter the Facebook user IDs of any users who should have access to Facebook insights for your dev blog.

## Disqus Shortname

<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='http://www.youtube.com/embed/qkiPNHS7aSw?modestbranding=1&rel=0&showinfo=0&theme=light' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
